# RTD Examples: Segway and Rover

This repository contains code for the paper, ["Bridging the Gap Between Safety and Real-Time Performance in Receding-Horizon Trajectory Design for Mobile Robots"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06746), which introduces **Reachability-based Trajectory Design**, or RTD.

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/ramvasudevan/RTD) and [tutorial](https://github.com/skousik/RTD_tutorial) to better understand the method. This repository follows the tutorial, but for the Segway and Rover instead of for the Turtlebot.

#### Getting Started

All the code in this repository runs in MATLAB (R2018a or newer).

This repository contains everything you need to start playing with RTD. We have included a "frozen in time" version of our simulator repository, and RTD repository.

To run the comparison code, you'll need to get [GPOPS](http://www.gpops2.com/) (free for academic).

#### Citing this Work
